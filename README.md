### Heyo!

My name is *echo4eva* online but some call me *perilEcho*, *lenkek*, and *echo*! I'm a 4th year college student studying in Computer Science just making stuff out of impulse, for fun, and to learn more!

**Just some stuff about me:**
- I love kpop, mostly fainting for LOONA 🌙 `while True: print("love") # love4eva!`
- I'm a "retired" FPS tryhard junky 🔫 getting into lifesims, settling down and living a peaceful life 🚜
- Mabinogi is my favorite MMORPG of all time ⚔️🛡️
- Creativity and personalization is my life source. Video editing, photography, music, fashion, and coding fits with it 🎵✏️

*So you might see stuff related to that!*

**Some of my goals:**
- Start small and make my own basic website that will include info similar to a linktree website
- Create a python discord bot with unique features for my friends
- Mod Stardew Valley with additions *(NPCs, Weapons, Mobs)* from Mabinogi and the Fate series
- Explore API's of Twitter and Spotify to create personalized features with given data
